## Hi, this is Tina.
This is the repository of my portfolio website.
I use vue and d3.js to make this website
and I choose firebase to deploy because it's pretty easy to implement in vue cli.

Hope you enjoy and feel free to share any opinions with me! Thanks!

## Project setup

npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

### Lints and fixes files
