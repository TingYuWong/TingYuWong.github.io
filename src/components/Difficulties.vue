        <h2>D3.js => draw axis, grids, and data</h2>
        <p>Before this full-time job, I don't have any practical experience. However, I got this tough task when I've been with the company for only one month. I finished it by overworking for a week. It's challenging, but that's why it's fruitful and memorable.</p>
        <h2>Reportlab</h2>
        <p>As a front-end developer, I'd love to learn back-end technologies to know web more. Therefore, I volunteered to study how to use reportlab and successfully created PDFs with complex interface. Although I felt overwhelmed when using python, it's worth it for the sense of achievement it gave me.</p>
        <h2>Memory Leak</h2>
        <p>In October 2021, users reported that one of our website would crash in thirty minutes almost everytime they used it. It took me two months to finally target where the bug is. It's an extremely frustrating process, but I did learn a lot about detecting memory leak and turning into a more experienced developer thanks to it.</p>
        <h2>webRTC</h2>
        <p>The outsourcing company asked us to finish this feature in two weeks, and that meant I only had four days to finish it, for I only did this project on the weekend. The worse was I'd never engaged into related technologies before. Even though I felt anxious and stressful, I still put my best foot forward and rolled out this feature on time as the company expected.</p>
